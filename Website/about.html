                    <h1>All about Ducky</h1>

                    <p>Ducky is a thoughtful innovator who is changing the world one scrub-a-dub-dub at a time. Ducky has become rather entranced
                        by the absolute creativity which can be found in the world of soap-making. From beautiful colors to engaging scents, Ducky
                        has mastered the art of soap-making after ten thousand years of dedication and study. After the Great Tragedy of 4035, Ducky travelled
                        back in time to save humanity through organic and ethically sourced soaps. As a result, the world as you see it is as prosperous as Ducky could manage.
                        Ducky finds joy knowing that the purchase of Ducky's Soaps prevents a terrible calamity in years to come. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Ducky would like all potential customers to know that their skin is in good hands when it comes to Ducky's Soaps. 
                        There are plenty of quack brands out there who are only interested in goosing money out of people in need of a simple bath time.
                        With Ducky's Soaps, Ducky guarantees a squeaky clean feel and a lovely time.
